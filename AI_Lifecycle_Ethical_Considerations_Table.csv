ML Modeling,"Transparency (Does the decision or inference process of the model can be understood?), Safety (Accuracy, Reliability, Security, and Robustness of the model), Fairness (Do model outputs show disparate results on different groups of people?)"
Model Deployment,"Privacy (Ensure private information cannot be re-identified through the deployed model), Safety (How to ensure the safety of the deployed model from malicious modification and attack?)"
